# Bachelor's Degree Final Project | Jesús Bautista Villar
**"Advanced microscopy techniques applied to cuttingedge material systems"**

### Abstract:

For every field in science, it is crucial to have access to characterization devices which allow
us to measure and experiment with theorical results. This need, added to a constant scientific
and technological progress, has motivated new outstanding microscopy techniques. This pro-
ject aims to explain aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM),
a fundamental tool in physics due to its great atomic-resolution and the great amount of
data we are able to extract from a single test. This large amount of data requires statistical
methods and artificial intelligence algorithms to be processed. The main purpose of this
project is to explore the main 4-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
(4D-STEM) data analysis techniques.
